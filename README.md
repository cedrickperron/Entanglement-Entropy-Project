# Entanglement-Entropy-Project
Some sample codes used for my Master Thesis Project. The goal of this project was to generate a fluctuating spacetime between Lifshitz and AdS geometries.

### Files
- `Entanglement_Entropy_Project.nb`: Mathematica file that generates the spacetime transitions and calculate the entanglement entropy
- `Entanglement_Entropy_Project.pdf`: PDF version of the Mathematica file.
- `MSc_Defense_Slides.pdf`: Contains the slides of my MSc Defence, which is basically a summary of the results.
